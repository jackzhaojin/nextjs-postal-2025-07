# Development Tests

This directory contains development and debugging tests that are not part of the main test suite but are useful for development, debugging, and validation purposes.

## Directory Structure

### `/pickup-debugging/`

Tests related to pickup scheduling functionality debugging and validation.

#### Pickup Debugging Tests:

- **`pickup-scheduling-debug.spec.ts`** - Main debug test that identified the infinite re-render issue in Contact & Instructions tab
- **`contact-tab-error-debug.spec.ts`** - Specific test for contact tab error capturing
- **`notifications-tab-debug.spec.ts`** - Debug test for notifications tab errors
- **`pickup-complete-test.spec.ts`** - Complete test of all pickup tabs (before simplification)
- **`pickup-simplified-test.spec.ts`** - Test of simplified pickup page (Location + Date/Time only)
- **`review-page-test.spec.ts`** - Basic review page functionality test
- **`e2e-pickup-review.spec.ts`** - End-to-end test from pickup to review
- **`final-pickup-validation.spec.ts`** - Comprehensive validation test

## Running Dev Tests

These tests can be run individually using Playwright **from the project root directory**:

```bash
# Run from project root (c:\code\nextjs-postal-2025-07\)

# Run a specific dev test
npx playwright test tests/dev-tests/pickup-debugging/pickup-simplified-test.spec.ts --reporter=line

# Run all pickup debugging tests
npx playwright test tests/dev-tests/pickup-debugging/ --reporter=line

# Run with headed mode for debugging
npx playwright test tests/dev-tests/pickup-debugging/final-pickup-validation.spec.ts --headed

# Run specific browser projects (optional)
npx playwright test tests/dev-tests/pickup-debugging/pickup-simplified-test.spec.ts --project=chromium --reporter=line
```

**Note**: Make sure to run these commands from the project root directory, not from within the `tests/dev-tests` folder, as Playwright needs access to the main configuration file.

## Purpose

These tests were created during the debugging process to:

1. **Identify Issues**: Found infinite re-render loops in pickup form components
2. **Validate Fixes**: Confirmed that simplifying the pickup flow resolved the issues
3. **Document Behavior**: Provide examples of working vs. broken functionality
4. **Regression Testing**: Ensure future changes don't break the pickup flow

## Test Results Summary

✅ **Working Components:**
- Location Details tab
- Date & Time tab
- Navigation between pickup and review
- Review page functionality

❌ **Removed Components (were causing errors):**
- Contact & Instructions tab (infinite re-render loop)
- Notifications & Authorization tab (undefined array mapping)

## Notes

- These tests are not included in the main npm test scripts
- They serve as documentation and debugging tools
- Screenshots generated by tests are saved in the project root
- Tests can be used for future development and troubleshooting
